            1. Arrangement of Fixtures
          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            <strong>1.1 Arrangement of Fixtures</strong>
            <br />
            The Honorary Secretary will arrange a fixture list each year for
            approval by the Committee and subsequently advise the Annual General
            Meeting.
            <br />
            <br />
            The Committee shall have the sole right to make changes in any
            published fixture list as may be deemed necessary from time to time.
            <br />
            <br />
            If a fixture is cancelled or abandoned, the Committee will attempt
            to re-arrange the fixture at a convenient future date. In the event
            that this is not possible, only those fixtures completed will count
            in the determination of the Order of Merit Winners.
          </p>

          <strong>1.2) Arrangements with Host Clubs</strong>
          <p className="mb-4">
            All affiliated Golf Clubs hosting a fixture will ensure the course
            is available from 07:00 to 15:30 hours or such other times as
            notified by the Honorary Secretary.
            <br />
            <br />
            <strong>1.3) When a Club is host to a Competition</strong>, the Club
            Secretary may contact the other affiliated Clubs and request
            courtesy for 8 of their Members. It is emphasized that this is not
            compulsory and while it is hoped that Clubs will honor this
            arrangement, it must be appreciated they may not be able to
            accommodate requests due to prior commitments.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">
            2. Conditions of Competition

            <br />
            <br />
            Players will indicate on their entry form their preference for a
            starting time, and as far as possible, this time will be allocated.
            However, since this will not always be possible, a time near to the
            time asked for will be allocated, but there may be a difference of
            45 minutes either way.
            <br />
            <br />
            In the event of postal or other difficulties arising, then the
            Honorary Secretary will advise all Clubs of any alternative
            arrangement for submitting entries.

              <strong>Embedded Ball</strong> - Through the green, a ball
              embedded in its own pitch mark in ground other than sand may be
              lifted, cleaned, and dropped without penalty, as near as possible
              to the spot where it lay but not nearer the hole. The ball when
              dropped must first strike a part of the course through the green.

              penalty, cleaned, and dropped, as near as possible to the spot
              where it lay but not nearer the hole. The ball when dropped must
              first strike a part of the course through the green. On the
              putting green, the player shall place the ball at the nearest spot
              not nearer the hole, which avoids such situation.
            </li>

          </h3>
          <p className="mb-4">
            1. In all Singles Strokeplay Competitions, the Competitors will play
            in three balls. In exceptional circumstances, it may be necessary
            for play to be in two or four balls but only at the discretion of
            the official in charge of the Competition.
            <br />
            <br />
            2. Players are required to collect their Scorecards 10 Minutes prior
            to their Start Time. Failure to do so may result in them being
            allocated a later Start Time. If they refuse to accept this ruling,
            they will still be required to pay their entry fee and cannot play
            again until it is paid.

            <br />
            3. <strong>Time of Starting (Rule of Golf 6.3a Note)</strong> - If
            the player arrives at his starting point, ready to play, within five
            minutes after his starting time, in the absence of circumstances
            which warrant waiving the penalty of disqualification as provided in
            Rule 33-7, the penalty for failure to start on time is the loss of
            the first hole to be played in match play or two strokes at the
            first hole in Strokeplay. The Committee has ruled that the penalty
            of disqualification for lateness beyond five minutes will be waived
            in individual cases and the player may then play if a later Start
            Time becomes available. If they subsequently refuse to play, they
            will still be required to pay the entry fee and cannot play again
            until it is paid.
